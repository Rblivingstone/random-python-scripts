# random-python-scripts
A collection of my random python scripts for work. They are mostly stripped down code that will require the input of a csv file. 
The code should be useable even though the csv file is not included. I try to modify the file so that it will be relevant for use outside
of my current position. For example, the mapit.py script takes a csv file with 3 columns: state,latitude,longitude.
